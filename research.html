    During my freshman year of college, I decided to join a research lab. I spent hours looking over the different labs UC San Diego had to offer, curious as to what field I wanted to go into. All I knew was that I liked science, I like programming, and I liked learning. 

  </div>
  <div class = "page-content">
    And that’s how I ended up in the Gilson Lab of Computational Chemistry. </div>

  <div class = "page-content">This is what I do.</div>

  <div class = "page-content">I run experiments. </div>
  <div class = "page-content">
The goal of our lab is to improve the way we use technology in drug discovery. In order to have something to test our programs against, we need something that’s true to facts. I help to synthesize novel host-guest bindings, and run ITC experiments to gather data that can be used to compare the same experiment but ran artificially on our computers. </div>
<div class = "page-content">
That was a lot of scientific jargon. In laymen’s terms: I put molecules together. These molecules aren’t always bounded by nature, but I want to see how they’ll behave and if they behave well together. Then I run these molecules in solution in a box that measures how much heat this release. I can use the data I gather from this to compare to the accuracy of computer simulations. The pictures at the top of this page are screenshots of a molecule I worked with-a betacyclodextrin host with a cyclooctanol guest. </div>
<div class = "page-content">
  I write code. </div>
  <div class = "page-content">
As a computational chemistry lab, we have to do computation too! One of my current projects is reweighting the OPC water molecule. So I worked on writing code with my mentor that would take in the data from a simulation of the water molecule, and run algorithms against it in order to calculate a single water molecules’ density, energy, and in the future: the enthalpy of mixing. Other projects we’ve worked on focused on calculating a species’ entropy in simulation and adjusting force field parameters while a simulation is in progress. </div>
<div class = "page-content">
  I learn.</div>
  <div class = "page-content">
This lab has been an amazing learning experience for me. It was an intimidating experience at first, but I’m glad to have joined and been able to see how what I was learning in school was applicable to life. Knowing that what I do can and will influence others drives me to keep exploring other applications of programming.</div>
